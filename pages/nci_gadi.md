### Directly on the HPC
#### Download databases
Tools in the ONTvisc pipeline compare the reads/clusters/contigs (depending on the mode) to a database or a reference. The explanation of which databases are required to be provided depending on the selected mode and tips on how to install them can be found in the pipeline's wiki page in the <a href="https://github.com/maelyg/ontvisc/wiki/Installation#installing-the-required-indexes-and-references"> Installing the required indexes and references </a> section. Below detailled instructions on how to do it on Gadi. Change links / versions if necessary.

mkdir -p /scratch/go97/ontvisc/databases/blastDB
